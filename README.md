# Quaternion PyTorch

This repository contains code to extend PyTorch for use in quaternion-valued applications. We provide quaternion-valued tensors, layers, and examples. Code is designed to be as inter-operable as possible with basic real-valued PyTorch tensors and operations.

This code draws in large part from Titouan Parcollet's [code](https://github.com/Orkis-Research/Pytorch-Quaternion-Neural-Networks), which inspired this library.

## Installation

After cloning the repository, simply run:

```
python setup.py install 
```

## Using the library

See the [Basic notebook](notebooks/basic.ipynb) for an introduction to the basic concepts in the library.
