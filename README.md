# Quaternion PyTorch

> :warning: **this is still heavily experimental**. Use at your own discretion!

This repository contains code to extend PyTorch for use in quaternion-valued applications. We provide quaternion-valued tensors, layers, and examples. Code is designed to be as inter-operable as possible with basic real-valued PyTorch tensors and operations.

This code draws in large part from Titouan Parcollet's [code](https://github.com/Orkis-Research/Pytorch-Quaternion-Neural-Networks), which inspired this library.

## Installation

After cloning the repository, simply run:

```
python setup.py install 
```

## Using the library

The basic unit of the library is the `QuaternionTensor`, and extension of PyTorch's tensor to handle quaternion-valued elements. We provide a number of operations from quaternion algebra and inter-operability with PyTorch:

```python
x = quaternion.QuaternionTensor(torch.rand(2, 4, requires_grad=True)) # A vector with two quaternions
x = x * torch.rand(2) # Multiply with real-valued scalars
x.norm.sum().backward() # Take the absolute value, sum, and take the gradient
```

See the [Basic notebook](notebooks/basic.ipynb) for an introduction to the basic concepts in the library.

# Testing

To manually run the unit tests:

```
python -m unittest discover -s ./tests -p *_test.py
```

If you have [coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) installed:

```
coverage run -m unittest discover -s ./tests -p *_test.py
```

To generate again the coverage badge (not automated yet), install [coverage-badge](https://pypi.org/project/coverage-badge/), then run:

```
coverage-badge -o coverage.svg -f
```
